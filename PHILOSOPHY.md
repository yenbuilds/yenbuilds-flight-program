# The YenBuilds Flight Simming Philosophy  
## Craft Over Engineering. Verisimilitude Over Realism.

The usual dividing line in flight simulation is between the “full-fidelity realists” and the casual hobbyists. Neither group defines what is being explored here. The YenBuilds ecosystem is driven by a different principle:

**This is not about engineering precision for its own sake.  
This is about craft — creating a believable aviation experience where every behaviour fits and makes sense.**

Realism is a narrow concept.  

Verisimilitude is broader: the appearance of truth, the sense that the simulated world behaves in a way the real world would, even if the implementation is not identical.

That is the goal.

## It Begins With *Why*  
Any simulation project without a clear *why* becomes pointless and rudderless.  

People get lost chasing fidelity for its own sake — perfect procedures, perfect offsets, perfect checklists — without ever asking what experience they’re actually trying to create.

The *why* of YenBuilds is simple:

**To build a flight environment that feels truthful, behaves coherently, and compels disciplined, meaningful flying.**

Without that *why*, the rest collapses into engineering busywork.  

With it, every system has direction and purpose.

## What Verisimilitude Means  
Verisimilitude does not require perfect procedures, accurate models of every system, or a full replication of airline SOP.  
It requires coherence.

If something happens in the simulation, your brain should immediately accept it as plausible.  
If you take an action, the aircraft should react in a way that aligns with aviation logic — energy, physics, aerodynamics, workload, state, consequences.

A simulator can fail to be “realistic” yet still be believable.  

It can be “accurate” yet feel lifeless.  

Verisimilitude is the point at which the experience earns your trust.

## Beyond Imitation: Designing What *Could* Be  
Verisimilitude is not only about copying reality. It is also about asking a different question:

**Given the rules of aviation, what *else* could exist that would make flying clearer, smarter, or more meaningful?**

The simulator is not bound by certification, hardware limits, or training doctrine. That makes it a place to explore two kinds of “what could be”:

1. **Sim-native helpers** that make flying easier or clearer than real life, without breaking the internal logic of aviation.  
2. **Conceptually new systems** that could never be trialled safely in the real world, but can mature in the simulator first.

### 1. Sim-Native Helpers That Stay Truthful  
Some tools would never survive in a real cockpit — not because they defy physics, but because they would overload or distract a real crew. In the sim, they can exist as honest training scaffolding:

TODO ...

The rule is simple:

> If a tool reveals the logic of flight more clearly, without violating physics or consequence, it belongs.

### 2. The Simulator as a Low-Risk Lab  
The second category is more ambitious: using the sim as a testbed for ideas that *might* have a place in future aviation, or that are valuable purely within the sim world.

- **New supervisory control laws** that watch the whole flight, not just a single autopilot mode.  
- **Experimental scoring or coaching systems** that shape pilot behaviour over dozens of flights, not just one landing grade.  
- **Novel cockpit symbology or overlays** that make energy, risk, or workload visible in ways real avionics never have.

In the real world, experimenting with these concepts is slow, regulated, and expensive. In the sim, they can iterate quickly, fail safely, and evolve towards something genuinely new.

The goal is not to create fantasy physics.  
The goal is to ask: *If we respect physics and operational logic, what better tools or behaviours could exist?*

The simulator becomes more than a replica. It becomes a small R&D lab for aviation ideas.

## Craft Over Engineering  
Engineering focuses on precision, specifications, and strict correctness.  
Craft focuses on intent and outcome.

Engineering asks whether the input matches the manual.  
Craft asks whether the aircraft feels alive and reacts meaningfully to what you do.

Every component in this ecosystem — software bridge, hardware interface, throttle system, overlay, scoring logic — is built to serve the experience, not the technical checklist.

The point is not to recreate a type-rating.  
The point is to create a world that behaves as aviation behaves.

---

## The Simulation Should Push Back  
A believable flight simulation needs consequences and state awareness.

There is no need for crash animations or theatrics.  
What matters is that the simulator can recognise and acknowledge when you have:

- landed badly  
- exited the runway  
- stalled  
- tail-struck  
- struck an object  
- exceeded limits  
- mishandled energy  
- violated logic or physics  

When the aircraft passes through objects without consequence, or when a crash is treated the same as a normal landing, the simulation breaks its own illusion. A tail strike that goes unacknowledged, or an impact that registers as nothing, removes all tension from the experience.

Feedback is what gives flying weight.  
A stable approach algorithm should tell you when you were not stable.  
Weather should expose poor judgment.  
Energy mismanagement should feel uncomfortable because the sim recognises it.  
Configurations should matter because the sim cares what you did.

A system without consequences is not a simulator; it is a sandbox.  
Verisimilitude requires the opposite: a machine that responds honestly.

## Meaningful Difficulty  
Difficulty is only worthwhile if it teaches something about aviation logic.

A challenging approach should feel challenging because the underlying physics demand precision, not because the code is punishing.

Bad weather, unstable energy states, windshear, poor configuration management — these should create friction because they would in real flying.

Difficulty without meaning is noise.  
Difficulty with meaning creates instinct.

## Evolution and Compounding  
None of the systems in this repository are static.  
They are designed to evolve, interlock, and compound into a deeper experience over time.

As new modules emerge, they enrich the existing ones:  
more data, clearer cues, tighter feedback, stronger behavioural logic.

The aim is a cockpit that grows in conviction, not complexity.

---

## Closing  
This entire project rests on a single conviction:

**Realism is a checklist.  
Verisimilitude is an experience.  
Craft is the method that creates it.  
Imagination is how we push it beyond imitation.**

Everything in this repository is built around that philosophy.  

If the outcome strengthens the illusion of flying — whether by mirroring reality or exploring what *could* exist — it belongs.  
If it adds technical complexity without improving the experience, it does not.

# YenBuilds Flight Simulation Ecosystem

This repository contains the evolving tools, hardware interfaces, overlays, data bridges, and experimental systems that make up the YenBuilds flight simulation environment.

The goal here is not strict realism or checklist replication.  
The goal is **verisimilitude** — a believable, coherent flying experience built through craft, not engineering theatre.

If you want to understand the guiding principles behind every system in this project, read the philosophy document:

## What This Repository Contains

- SimConnect and FSUIPC integration experiments  
- Motorised throttle and hardware interface logic  
- Telemetry bridges for overlays and analytics  
- Stable approach and energy state evaluation systems  
- HUD and overlay prototypes  
- General tooling that supports the broader flight environment  

This is a living ecosystem. Modules evolve, interlock, and compound over time.

## Project Intent

This repository is not a polished “product.”  
It is the active working environment behind the YenBuilds cockpit systems.

Expect:

- experiments  
- iteration  
- evolving code  
- modular design  
- continuous refinement  

Everything here exists to support one thing: a flight experience that behaves truthfully.

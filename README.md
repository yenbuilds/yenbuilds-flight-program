# YenBuilds Flight Simulation Ecosystem

This repository contains the evolving tools, hardware interfaces, overlays, data bridges, and many other experimental systems.

The goal here is not strict realism or checklist replication. 

The goal is **verisimilitude** — a believable, coherent flying experience built through craft.

If you want to understand the guiding principles behind every system in this project, read the philosophy document:

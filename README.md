# YenBuilds Flight Simulation Ecosystem

This repository contains the evolving tools, hardware interfaces, overlays, data bridges, and experimental systems that make up the YenBuilds flight simulation environment.

The goal here is not strict realism or checklist replication.  
The goal is **verisimilitude** — a believable, coherent flying experience built through craft, not engineering theatre.

## What This Repository Contains

- Coming soon.

This is a living ecosystem. Modules evolve, interlock, and compound over time.

---

## Project Intent

This repository is not a polished “product.”  
It is the active working environment behind the YenBuilds cockpit systems.

Expect:

- experiments  
- iteration  
- evolving code  
- modular design  
- continuous refinement  

Everything here exists to support one thing: a flight experience that behaves truthfully.

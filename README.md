# YenBuilds Flight Simulation Ecosystem

This repository contains the evolving tools, hardware interfaces, overlays, data bridges, and many other experimental systems.

The goal at this stage, is not strict realism or checklist replication. 

The goal today, is to explore and develop tools that enhance the flight sim experience.

If you want to understand the guiding principles behind every system in this project.

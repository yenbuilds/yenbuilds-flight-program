# VNAV Speed Debrief – Why the 777 “Refused” to Slow Down

## Overview

During a short, same-airport hop in the PMDG 777, VNAV and the autothrottle appeared to “refuse” to slow the aircraft during descent.

- MCP altitude was set **below** current altitude (e.g. MCP **4900 ft**, actual **~7000 ft**).  
- VNAV was engaged, autothrottle armed, FMC showed a **much lower target speed**.  
- Instead of reducing thrust and decelerating, the FMA annunciated **THR / VNAV SPD**, N1 increased into the **70–80%** range, and the aircraft stayed roughly level while accelerating.  
- Later, the thrust mode changed to **HOLD**, leaving high thrust in until it was manually reduced.

This debrief covers:

- What actually happened  
- The real cause  
- How to avoid a repeat

## 1. What Actually Happened

### Simplified Sequence

1. Aircraft around **7000 ft**, MCP set to **4900 ft**.  
2. VNAV engaged, autothrottle armed.  
3. **ALTITUDE knob is pushed** (Altitude Intervention / ALT INTV).  
4. Immediately after the push:
   - FMA shows **THR** (thrust mode) on the left.  
   - FMA shows **VNAV SPD** (pitch mode) on the right, boxed.  
   - Engines spool up; N1 climbs toward **climb-ish thrust**.  
   - Aircraft remains near 7000 ft and **accelerates** instead of descending.
5. After some time, thrust mode changes to **HOLD**:
   - Autothrottle servos release.  
   - Thrust stays where it was until the motorised throttle is moved by hand.

From the cockpit it feels like:

> “VNAV is on, MCP is lower, FMC wants a slower speed…  
> Why is it at 80% N1 and not going down?”

## 2. Technical Cause – Mode, Not Hardware

### 2.1 ALT INTV Is **Not** “Descend 1500 ft”

On the Boeing 777:

- **Rotating** the altitude selector = change MCP **altitude limit**.  
- **Pushing** the knob in VNAV = **Altitude Intervention (ALT INTV)**.

ALT INTV does **not** mean:

> “Descend now by this amount.”

It actually means:

> “VNAV, adjust your vertical profile and go to this MCP altitude according to your own rules and constraints.”

When ALT INTV was pressed, VNAV looked at its internal vertical path/constraints and decided the next action was **not** “idle descend”, but:

- Apply **climb thrust** and  
- Use **VNAV SPD** to manage speed.

Hence the FMA:

- **THR** – apply climb power  
- **VNAV SPD** – pitch for speed, not for a geometric descent path  

That combination is **not** a descent mode. It’s a **powered VNAV speed mode**.

---

### 2.2 THR / VNAV SPD → High N1, No Descent

In **THR / VNAV SPD**:

- Autothrottle **commands higher thrust** to maintain or chase the VNAV target speed.  
- Pitch keeps speed under control, **not** the descent path.  
- On a short, weird profile, VNAV’s internal logic may not be aiming down at that point at all.

Result:

- The airplane can happily sit at ~7000 ft and accelerate, despite MCP being set lower and the FMC showing a lower speed.

That’s exactly what happened:  
ALT INTV pushed VNAV into a powered mode instead of an idle descent.

---

### 2.3 Transition to HOLD → You Own Thrust

Later, the FMA changed to **HOLD**:

- In **HOLD**, the A/T **releases the servos** and stops commanding thrust.  
- The A/T ARM switch can still be lit – that only means “available”, not “controlling”.  
- Thrust stays exactly where it was when HOLD engaged until the pilot moves the levers.

That’s why:

- N1 stayed high even after modes shifted.  
- Only **moving the throttle manually** reduced thrust and allowed deceleration.

This is normal 777 behaviour: in HOLD, **you are the autothrottle**.

---

### 2.4 Short, Same-Airport Profile Made VNAV Dumber

Contributing factor: the profile itself.

- Same-airport hop  
- Never above ~10,000 ft  
- Very little distance to descend **and** decelerate  
- No real climb or cruise  
- Likely odd or minimal constraints in the FMC

VNAV is designed for a full **climb–cruise–descent** profile. On a tiny local hop:

- The calculated VNAV path may be physically unrealistic.  
- There’s almost no room to manage energy smoothly.  
- ALT INTV can easily push VNAV into modes that make **zero intuitive sense** with so little distance and height.

So VNAV was “technically doing its job”, but the job no longer matched expectations.

---

### 2.5 Throttle System: Not the Root Cause

Throttle hardware design:

- 110 mm motorised fader  
- Only part of the travel used for forward thrust  
- Virtual idle detent around mid-travel  
- Deadbands around target positions so the DC motor doesn’t hunt

In this incident:

- With **THR** active, the motorised throttle correctly followed the commanded thrust.  
- When A/T switched to **HOLD**, the throttle stayed at that high position (no more servo changes).  
- Pulling it back by hand reduced thrust as expected.

That’s exactly what it *should* do, given the modes.

Calibration can always be improved, but it is **not** why the aircraft sat at high N1 instead of idling down here. This was mode logic, not motor failure.

---

## 3. Human Factors – Where It Actually Went Wrong

### 3.1 Mode Confusion

Assumed:

- “MCP lower + ALT push = descend 1500 ft.”

Reality:

- “ALT INTV in VNAV = ‘VNAV, adjust your vertical profile to reach this MCP altitude.’”

No immediate reaction when the FMA clearly showed **THR / VNAV SPD**, which is **not** a descent mode.

### 3.2 Overtrusting VNAV on a Bad Profile

- VNAV was used like a “magic descent” tool on a short, non-standard, same-airport hop.  
- That’s exactly where VNAV is weakest – the vertical math is tuned for real routes with distance to work with.

### 3.3 Late Recognition of HOLD

- Once the A/T went to **HOLD**, thrust control was completely manual.  
- The mental model was still “autothrottle’s handling it”, long after it wasn’t.

---

## 4. How to Avoid This in Future

### 4.1 FMA Discipline – Non-Negotiable

New rule:

> **If the FMA doesn’t show what you expect, treat that mode as failed and fix it immediately.**

On descent, if the goal is “go down and slow down”, you generally want:

- Thrust: **IDLE** (or at least not THR), and  
- Pitch: **VNAV PTH**, or a simple descent mode like FLCH/V/S

If you see on descent:

- **THR / VNAV SPD** and the aircraft is not descending as expected →  
  **Stop trusting VNAV right there.**

---

### 4.2 Stop Using ALT INTV as a “Descend Now” Button

New mental model:

- The ALT knob in VNAV is **not** an Airbus “descend now” control.  
- ALT INTV is for managing constraints on a **proper route**, not for casually “bumping down 1500 ft” on a short hop.

If the intention is **“go down now”**, do this instead:

1. Set the MCP altitude to the target level.  
2. Use **FLCH** or **V/S**:
   - **FLCH** – thrust to idle, pitch for MCP speed → guaranteed descent.  
   - **V/S** – you pick the rate, and manage thrust/speed yourself.

---

### 4.3 Use Basic Modes as the Escape Hatch

When the descent looks wrong or energy is off:

1. **Check the FMA**
   - If you see **THR** or **HOLD** when expecting an idle descent, that’s a mismatch.

2. **Drop to a simple mode**
   - Press **FLCH** with MCP set to the actual target altitude.

3. **Control speed + energy**
   - Set a sensible speed (e.g. 240–260 kt clean).  
   - Use speedbrake and early configuration as needed.

4. **Optionally re-enter VNAV later**
   - Once stable again, re-arm VNAV or approach modes *if* you’re on a sensible route.

---

### 4.4 Use VNAV Where It Makes Sense

VNAV works best when:

- There’s a proper **route** with SIDs/STARs.  
- The flight has a real **climb, cruise, and descent**.  
- The FMC vertical plan corresponds to something physically reasonable.

For **same-airport, sub-10k practice**:

- Treat them as **vector-to-ILS** or basic instrument approaches:
  - Step altitudes in MCP,  
  - FLCH or V/S,  
  - Manual speed/drag management.
- Save VNAV experiments for proper legs where it can actually do its job.

---

### 4.5 Hardware – Improve It, Don’t Blame It for Mode Errors

Reasonable tweaks:

- Confirm the fader’s virtual idle zone maps to **true idle thrust** in the sim.  
- Keep deadbands tight so “idle” is not secretly some mid-thrust value.  
- But remember: if the FMA shows **THR** or **HOLD**, the thrust behaviour is driven by:
  - The active mode, plus  
  - Whatever the levers are actually doing in that mode,

not by random mechanical voodoo.

---

## 5. Summary

This incident was **not** about:

- VNAV being “broken”  
- Autothrottle “ignoring” the FMC speed  
- The throttle hardware randomly misbehaving  

It was about:

- **ALT INTV used at the wrong time**, pushing the aircraft into **THR / VNAV SPD** instead of a descent mode.  
- VNAV trying to operate on a **bad, very short profile**.  
- **HOLD** handing thrust back to the pilot while the pilot still believed A/T was managing it.  
- A mental model that treated Boeing VNAV like an Airbus-style “descend now” button.

The fix is boring but effective:

- **Watch the FMA, not the switch lights.**  
- **Stop using ALT INTV as a descent shortcut.**  
- **Use FLCH/V/S as the “get me down sanely” button on weird profiles.**  
- Use VNAV on flights where it actually has enough distance and structure to work with.

# VNAV Speed Debrief – Why the 777 "Refused" to Slow Down During Descent   

**Simulator:** Aerofly FS  
**Aircraft:** Boeing 777-300ER  

---

## Overview

During a short, same-airport hop in the Aerofly 777, VNAV and the autothrottle appeared to "refuse" to slow the aircraft during descent.

- MCP altitude was set **below** the aircraft (~4900 ft vs ~7000 ft).  
- VNAV was engaged, autothrottle armed.  
- Instead of reducing thrust and descending, the FMA displayed **THR / VNAV SPD**, N1 increased to ~70–80%, and the aircraft accelerated in level flight.  
- Later the autothrottle transitioned to **HOLD**, leaving thrust frozen until manually reduced.

This debrief explains:

- What actually happened  
- Why this occurred due to **VNAV profile issues**, not hardware  
- How to properly use ALT intervention on the 777  
- How to prevent this scenario in the future

## 1. What Actually Happened

### Simplified Sequence

1. Aircraft at ~7000 ft, MCP altitude dialed down to **4900 ft**.  
2. VNAV active, autothrottle armed.  
3. **ALT knob was NOT pushed** (or was pushed while VNAV had no valid descent path).  
4. VNAV stayed in or reverted to:
   - **THR** (autothrottle commanding thrust)  
   - **VNAV SPD** (pitch controlling speed)  
5. Aircraft remained level and **accelerated**, not descending.  
6. Autothrottle later entered **HOLD**, freezing thrust at a high value until the pilot reduced it manually.

Cockpit perception:

> "VNAV wants to slow down and MCP is lower—why isn't it descending?"

---

## 2. Technical Cause – VNAV Path Unavailable

### 2.1 The 777 DOES Have Altitude Intervention

Contrary to earlier assumptions, **the Boeing 777 has ALT INTV functionality**.

Per the Aerofly 777 documentation:

> **Altitude Intervention in VNAV ALT:**  
> When the MCP selected altitude is captured with VNAV active or armed, VNAV ALT engages. This indicates that the climb or descent has been interrupted.
>
> To continue:  
> - Rotate the altitude knob to set a new target altitude  
> - **Click (push) the altitude knob** to continue the climb or descent in **VNAV SPD** or **VNAV PTH**

**Pushing the ALT knob releases VNAV from altitude hold and commands it to continue toward the new MCP altitude.**

---

### 2.1.1 What ALT INTV Actually Does (Official Boeing Documentation)

The following is sourced from official Boeing Flight Crew Training Manuals (FCTM) and airline operator manuals:

#### Primary Function

> **"Altitude Intervention allows pilots to quickly change the aircraft altitude without reprogramming the FMC, disengaging VNAV, or spending excessive 'heads down' time."**  
> — *Boeing 737 FCTM*

ALT INTV **takes precedence over VNAV** while keeping VNAV armed. It allows manual deletion of the next FMC altitude constraint via the MCP altitude selector.

#### Boeing 777 Procedure (from Continental Airlines Boeing 777 Flight Manual)

On the 777, there is **no separate ALT INTV button** — the function is activated by **pushing the MCP altitude selector knob**.

> **"Each push of the MCP altitude selector knob deletes the next waypoint altitude constraint between the airplane altitude and the altitude window."**  
> — *Continental Airlines Boeing 777 Flight Manual, Section 6.4*

**Climb or Descent:**
1. Set the desired altitude in the MCP altitude window  
2. Push the MCP altitude selector knob  
3. Each push deletes the next waypoint altitude constraint  
4. Aircraft climbs or descends to the new altitude  

**Cruise Altitude Change:**

> **"Once the cruise altitude is attained (VNAV PTH), MCP altitude intervention higher or lower automatically updates the FMC cruise altitude (cruise climb and cruise descent). This allows the crew to raise or lower the current altitude without using the CDU, and without confirmation by having to use the EXEC key."**  
> — *Continental Airlines Boeing 777 Flight Manual*

**Descend Now (DES NOW) Feature:**

> **"Within 50 NM of the top-of-descent (T/D) point, with the altitude window set below cruise altitude, the airplane initiates the descend now (DES NOW) feature."**  
> — *Continental Airlines Boeing 777 Flight Manual*

#### Boeing 737 Procedure (from Boeing 737 FCTM)

> **"Altitude intervention (as installed) is accomplished by selecting the next desired altitude in the MCP altitude window, pushing the MCP ALT INTV switch which deletes the altitude constraint and allows the airplane to climb to the MCP altitude."**  
> — *Boeing 737 FCTM*

**Key behaviors:**
- **Climb:** Aircraft climbs using N1 thrust. FMC automatically updates CRZ ALT to the new MCP altitude.
- **Descent:** Aircraft descends at **default 1000 fpm** until reaching the selected altitude. Note: FMC does **not** automatically update CRZ ALT during descent — this must be done manually if permanent.

#### When to Use ALT INTV

Per Boeing documentation, altitude intervention is appropriate when:

- ATC clears the flight to **"climb direct"** or **"descend direct"** to a higher/lower altitude, bypassing programmed restrictions  
- A temporary change in altitude is required with a return to the original altitude imminent  
- To clear altitude restrictions during climb or descent when relieved by ATC  
- To initiate an **early descent** before reaching the calculated Top of Descent (TOD)  
- During approach phase to command a VNAV descent to the next constraint if MCP altitude was not reset in time  

#### Key Differences: 737 vs 777

| Feature | Boeing 737 | Boeing 777 |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Hardware** | Dedicated ALT INTV button (Honeywell MCP) or push ALT knob (Collins MCP) | Push altitude selector knob (integrated) |
| **Climb** | Auto-updates FMC CRZ ALT | Auto-updates FMC CRZ ALT |
| **Descent** | Does **NOT** auto-update FMC CRZ ALT | **Auto-updates** FMC CRZ ALT |
| **Default descent rate** | 1000 fpm | 1000 fpm |

### 2.2 Why It Didn't Work in This Case

Even with ALT INTV available, VNAV **cannot descend** unless:

1. The MCP altitude is set **below** the current altitude ✓  
2. VNAV has a **valid vertical profile** to follow ✗

On this ultra-short hop:

- There was no proper flight plan vertical path  
- VNAV had no geometric descent profile (VNAV PTH unavailable)  
- VNAV fell back to **VNAV SPD**, a speed-on-pitch mode  
- In VNAV SPD during level flight, A/T commanded **THR** to maintain speed  

**Result:** The aircraft accelerated instead of descending.

---

### 2.3 Why VNAV Selected THR / VNAV SPD

When VNAV's geometric path is invalid or the aircraft is far off profile:

- VNAV cannot enter **VNAV PTH** (no valid descent path)  
- It reverts to **VNAV SPD**, commanding pitch to hold speed  
- A/T may command **THR** to maintain or increase speed  
- The aircraft ignores the lower MCP altitude (no path to follow)

**THR / VNAV SPD is a speed-holding mode, not a descent mode.**

---

### 2.4 Why Thrust "Froze" in HOLD

Later, A/T changed to **HOLD**:

- A/T servos released  
- Thrust remained at the physical throttle position  
- A/T ARM light remained illuminated (A/T available, not active)

In HOLD, the pilot must manage thrust manually.

---

### 2.5 The Real Cause: No Valid VNAV Profile

This was:

- A same-airport hop  
- Very little distance  
- No proper climb, cruise, or descent planning  
- No geometric vertical path for VNAV to follow

VNAV is designed for full climb–cruise–descent profiles. On ultra-short sectors:

- The vertical path is often invalid  
- VNAV SPD is common  
- Powered modes (THR) appear frequently  
- The aircraft may never reach VNAV PTH conditions

**VNAV wasn't "broken" — there simply was no valid path to descend on.**

---

## 3. Human Factors – Where Confusion Arose

### 3.1 Missed the ALT Intervention Step

To descend with VNAV after leveling:

1. Set the MCP altitude to the **new target altitude**  
2. **Push the ALT knob** to execute altitude intervention  
3. VNAV should transition to VNAV SPD or VNAV PTH for descent

If the knob was pushed but nothing happened → **VNAV had no valid path**.

---

### 3.2 FMA Was Not Monitored

The FMA showed:

- **THR / VNAV SPD**

This is **not** a descent mode.

Expected descent modes:

- **IDLE / VNAV PTH** (geometric descent)  
- **IDLE / FLCH SPD** (flight level change)  
- **HOLD / V/S** (pilot-selected vertical speed)

> **If the FMA doesn't show IDLE + a descent mode, the aircraft is NOT descending.**

---

### 3.3 Using VNAV in an Unsuitable Scenario

VNAV is powerful **only when the vertical profile is valid**.

A same-airport hop is one of the **worst** VNAV scenarios — there's nothing for VNAV to follow.

---

## 4. How to Avoid This in the Future

### 4.1 Golden Rule:  
# **FMA Before FMC Before MCP**

Always check the FMA after any MCP input.

Expected descent modes:

- **IDLE / VNAV PTH**  
- **IDLE / FLCH SPD**  
- **HOLD / V/S**

If you see **THR / VNAV SPD** → **you are NOT descending**.

---

### 4.2 Proper ALT Intervention Procedure

To descend using VNAV:

1. **Set MCP altitude** to target altitude  
2. **Push the ALT knob** to execute altitude intervention  
3. **Verify FMA** shows VNAV PTH or VNAV SPD with IDLE thrust  

If VNAV doesn't respond → the vertical profile is invalid.

---

### 4.3 When VNAV Won't Work: Use FLCH

If VNAV has no valid path, use **FLCH** (Flight Level Change):

1. Set MCP altitude to target  
2. Press **FLCH**  
3. A/T commands **IDLE**  
4. Pitch maintains target speed  
5. Aircraft descends **immediately**  

FLCH is the tactical descent mode when VNAV isn't cooperating.

---

### 4.4 Use VNAV Where It Makes Sense

**Ideal for VNAV:**

- Real routes with proper waypoints  
- Full climb–cruise–descent profiles  
- STARs with altitude/speed constraints  
- Adequate descent distance

**Not ideal:**

- Circuits  
- Pattern work  
- Same-airport hops  
- Short experimental flights

---

### 4.5 Hardware Was Not the Cause

The throttle hardware behaved correctly:

- Followed A/T commands in **THR**  
- Froze in **HOLD**  
- Responded to manual thrust reduction

This was **100% VNAV logic** due to missing vertical profile, not mechanical error.

---

## 5. Summary

This incident was **not** caused by:

- Missing ALT INTV feature (the 777 **does** have it)  
- Autothrottle failure  
- Throttle hardware issues  

It was caused by:

- **No valid VNAV vertical profile** (ultra-short hop)  
- VNAV reverting to **VNAV SPD** with **THR** mode  
- A/T entering **HOLD**, freezing high thrust  
- Not recognizing that VNAV had no path to follow

### The Fix:

- **The 777 HAS altitude intervention** — push the ALT knob after dialing a new altitude  
- **Watch the FMA** — it tells you what the aircraft is actually doing  
- **Use FLCH** when VNAV has no valid profile  
- **Reserve VNAV for realistic routes** with proper flight plans

# VNAV Speed Debrief – Why the 777 “Refused” to Slow Down During Descent   

[YPL] This sounds *believable*, but I have doubts of the accuracy of the explanation regarding the MCP ALT knob behaviour on the PMDG 777. If you have access to official Boeing manuals or PMDG docs that clarify this, I've love to know!!

---


## Overview

During a short, same-airport hop in the PMDG 777, VNAV and the autothrottle appeared to “refuse” to slow the aircraft during descent.

- MCP altitude was set **below** the aircraft (~4900 ft vs ~7000 ft).  
- VNAV was engaged, autothrottle armed, and the FMC commanded a significantly lower speed.  
- Instead of reducing thrust and descending, the FMA displayed **THR / VNAV SPD**, N1 increased to ~70–80%, and the aircraft accelerated in level flight.  
- Later the autothrottle transitioned to **HOLD**, leaving thrust frozen until manually reduced.

This debrief explains:

- What actually happened  
- Why this is **normal 777 behaviour**, not a fault  
- Why it was caused by **mode logic**, not hardware  
- How to prevent this scenario in the future

## 1. What Actually Happened

### Simplified Sequence

1. Aircraft at ~7000 ft, MCP set to **4900 ft**.  
2. VNAV active, autothrottle armed.  
3. The **MCP altitude knob was pushed**.  
4. VNAV re-evaluated its vertical logic and selected:
   - **THR** (autothrottle commanding thrust)  
   - **VNAV SPD** (pitch controlling speed)  
5. Aircraft remained level and **accelerated**, not descending.  
6. Autothrottle later entered **HOLD**, freezing thrust at a high value until the pilot reduced it manually.

Cockpit perception:

> “VNAV wants to slow down and MCP is lower—why isn’t it descending?”

---

## 2. Technical Cause – Mode Logic, Not Hardware

### 2.1 The Critical Point:
# **The Boeing 777 does *not* have ALT INTV**

Unlike the 737 NG/MAX:

- The 777 does **not** have a switch that deletes FMC altitude constraints.  
- **Pressing the MCP ALT knob does not behave like 737 ALT INTV.**

On the 777, pushing the altitude knob:

- **Does NOT delete FMC altitude constraints**  
- **Does NOT command an immediate descent**  
- **Does NOT override VNAV’s vertical profile**

Instead, the push simply:

> **Cancels VNAV ALT capture and allows VNAV to resume its own vertical logic.**

In this case, VNAV resumed into **VNAV SPD**, not **VNAV PTH**.

---

### 2.2 Why VNAV Selected THR / VNAV SPD

When VNAV’s path is invalid or the aircraft is far off profile (common on very short hops):

- VNAV cannot enter VNAV PTH  
- It reverts to **VNAV SPD**, a speed-on-pitch mode  
- It may command **THR**, which maintains or increases speed  
- It ignores the lower MCP altitude until conditions are met

**THR / VNAV SPD is *not* a descent mode.**

Result:

- Level flight  
- High thrust  
- Acceleration  
- No descent

This is exactly what occurred.

---

### 2.3 Why Thrust “Froze” in HOLD

Later, A/T changed to **HOLD**:

- A/T servos release  
- Thrust remains at the physical throttle position  
- A/T ARM light remains illuminated (A/T available, not active)

In HOLD, the pilot becomes the autothrottle.

This explains why:

- High N1 persisted  
- The aircraft would not slow down until the pilot reduced thrust

Again, **correct Boeing logic**.

---

### 2.4 The Real Cause: An Unrealistic VNAV Profile

This was:

- A same-airport hop  
- Very little distance  
- No proper climb  
- No cruise  
- A forced early descent

VNAV is designed for full climb–cruise–descent profiles. On ultra-short sectors:

- The vertical path may be invalid  
- VNAV SPD is common  
- Powered modes (THR) appear frequently  
- The aircraft may never reach VNAV PTH conditions

VNAV wasn’t “wrong” — the *scenario* was.

---

## 3. Human Factors – Where Confusion Arose

### 3.1 Incorrect Mental Model of the ALT Knob

The assumption was:

> “Push ALT → descend now.”

This is **737 logic**, not 777 logic.

On the 777:

- ALT push **does not** trigger a descent  
- **VNAV decides** when/if it will descend  
- If VNAV chooses VNAV SPD, the aircraft may:
  - level  
  - accelerate  
  - ignore the lower MCP altitude

The behaviour was correct; the expectation was not.

---

### 3.2 FMA Discipline Was Missed

The FMA showed:

- **THR / VNAV SPD**

This is *never* a descent mode.

If the FMA does not show **IDLE / VNAV PTH**, **IDLE / FLCH SPD**, or a pilot-commanded **V/S**:

> **The airplane will not descend.**

---

### 3.3 Overusing VNAV in the Worst Possible Scenario

VNAV is powerful **only when the vertical profile is sensible**.

A same-airport hop is one of the worst possible VNAV scenarios.

---

## 4. How to Avoid This in the Future

### 4.1 Golden Rule:  
# **FMA Before FMC Before MCP**

Always check the FMA.

Expected descent modes:

- **IDLE / VNAV PTH**  
- **IDLE / FLCH SPD**  
- **HOLD / V/S** (pilot-managed thrust)

If you see **THR / VNAV SPD** → **you are NOT descending**.

---

### 4.2 Do Not Use ALT Push as a Descent Command

Because it isn’t.

To descend immediately in a 777:

### Use **FLCH**
- Thrust → **IDLE**  
- Pitch → maintain target speed  
- Aircraft → descends *immediately*  

FLCH is the Boeing-approved tactical descent mode.

---

### 4.3 If VNAV Misbehaves: Drop It

If VNAV is stuck or doing something unexpected:

1. Dial lower MCP altitude  
2. Press **FLCH**  
3. Stabilise the aircraft  
4. Re-engage VNAV later if appropriate

VNAV is optional — not sacred.

---

### 4.4 Use VNAV Where It Makes Sense

Ideal for VNAV:

- Real routes  
- Proper climb and cruise  
- Adequate descent distance  
- STARs with geometric constraints

Not ideal:

- Circuits  
- Pattern work  
- Same-airport hops  
- Descent experiments at 10 miles

---

### 4.5 Hardware Was Not the Cause

Your motorised throttle behaved correctly:

- Followed A/T commands in **THR**  
- Froze in **HOLD**  
- Responded to manual thrust reduction

This was **100% mode logic**, not mechanical error.

---

## 5. Summary

This incident was **not** caused by:

- Autothrottle failure  
- VNAV “ignoring” speed  
- Throttle hardware issues  

It was caused by:

- Misunderstanding the function of the 777 ALT knob  
- VNAV selecting **THR / VNAV SPD** due to an invalid vertical path  
- A/T entering **HOLD**, freezing high thrust  
- Using VNAV on a profile it wasn’t designed for

The fix:

- **Watch the FMA — it tells the truth.**  
- **Use FLCH to command descents.**  
- **Reserve VNAV for realistic routes.**  
- **Remember: the 777 does NOT have ALT INTV.**

## Flight Debrief – Unstable 777 Autoland (S-turns on Short Final)

**Aircraft:** Boeing 777 (MSFS)  
**Add-ons in use:** PMDG 777, FSRealistic (community 777 profile with beta “flight dynamics” effects enabled)  
**Issue:** Pronounced left–right “swerving” during autoland in light crosswind

---

### 1. Summary of the Problem

During several ILS autoland approaches in light crosswind conditions (around 7 kt), the aircraft:

- Hunts left and right on the localizer  
- Banks noticeably near the ground  
- Feels unstable and “snaky” in the flare / short final phase  

The behaviour was repeatable at multiple airports, which initially suggested:

- Not a single corrupted scenery or localizer  
- Not obviously a hardware calibration problem  
- Not obviously a navdata issue  

The aircraft appeared to be “S-turning down the glideslope” instead of tracking a stable path.

---

### 2. Initial Suspects Considered (and Cleared)

The following potential causes were investigated and ruled out:

1. **Throttle hardware / custom motorized throttle**
   - No differential thrust was being commanded.  
   - Both engines were driven symmetrically.  
   - Disconnecting or bypassing the custom throttle did not remove the behaviour.

2. **Primary flight controls (T.16000, etc.)**
   - Control bindings were checked for duplicate aileron/rudder axes.  
   - No stuck or noisy roll/yaw inputs consistently visible on sensitivity graphs.  
   - Issue persisted even when suspicious bindings were removed.

3. **Node.js / FSUIPC / external code**
   - External code was not writing to aileron, rudder or differential throttle offsets.  
   - Autothrottle logic, where active, moved thrust levers together, not asymmetrically.  
   - Disabling external modules did not fully resolve the behaviour.

4. **Airport / navdata issues**
   - The same “swerving” behaviour occurred at multiple, unrelated airports.  
   - This reduced the likelihood of a single bad ILS or misaligned localizer.

At this stage the aircraft, hardware and code were largely exonerated.

### 3. Root Cause: FSRealistic Community Profile (Beta Flight Dynamics Effect)

The actual culprit was identified as:

> **An FSRealistic profile for the 777 that enabled a beta feature which was actively modifying flight dynamics during approach and landing.**

Key points:

- This profile was not just camera shake – it was injecting forces / disturbances into the sim.  
- The community profile in use:
  - Was popular and highly rated.  
  - Had one or more **beta “flight dynamics / landing / crosswind” effects** enabled.  
  - Introduced **additional yaw/roll/side-force inputs** to simulate turbulence / crosswind / ground handling.

This meant:

- The autopilot wasn’t simply tracking a clean ILS; it was constantly fighting **external, artificial disturbances** being layered on top of the normal MSFS flight model.  
- Near the ground, with:
  - Higher localizer sensitivity  
  - Lower speeds  
  - Tighter bank limits in LAND mode  
  these injected effects showed up as visible **S-turns and banking** as the AP tried to recenter.

Once the FSRealistic beta dynamics feature was disabled / the profile corrected, the autoland behaviour stabilised with the same hardware, same airplane and similar conditions.

### 4. Why It Looked and Felt So Extreme

Several factors combined to make the effect look like “the AP has lost its mind”:

1. **Injected dynamics on top of real crosswind**
   - A light real-world crosswind was already present.  
   - FSRealistic then added its own additional yaw/roll/turbulence behaviour.  
   - The result was **more disturbance than the 777’s AP is tuned for**, especially close to the ground.

2. **High sensitivity of autoland near the ground**
   - In LAND mode, the autopilot is trying to stay tightly on the localizer and glideslope.  
   - It has limited authority to bank aggressively at low altitude.  
   - When you add artificial lateral disturbances, the AP constantly chases them → visible S-turns.

3. **Workload and attention**
   - The pilot was simultaneously:
     - Learning the 777 automation  
     - Managing custom hardware  
     - Handling real-world distractions  
   - Under that workload, it’s natural to blame:
     - Hardware  
     - Code  
     - Aircraft logic  
     before suspecting “that one beta effect in an add-on”.

4. **Trust in community presets**
   - The profile was “most popular” / heavily downloaded, which implied:
     - “This must be the good one.”  
   - In reality, it included an experimental setting that was **not appropriate for precise autoland work**.

---

### 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Popular ≠ Safe for Precision Ops**
   - Community presets can enable beta or extreme effects that are fine for “cinematic chaos” but terrible for:
     - ILS work  
     - Autoland testing  
     - Serious training-style flights  

2. **Separate *core aircraft behaviour* from *third-party dynamics injection***
   - If something feels wrong with how the aircraft flies:
     - Disable add-ons that can affect **physics**, not just visuals.  
     - Test again with those effects off.  
   - If the problem disappears, the issue is coming from third-party dynamics, not the base aircraft.

3. **Have a “Clean Testing / Serious Ops” configuration**
   - Create a profile with:
     - FSRealistic *dynamics* effects off (or extremely mild)  
     - No beta / experimental behaviour enabled  
     - Minimal external interference with the flight model  
   - Use that whenever:
     - Testing hardware or code  
     - Evaluating autoland performance  
     - Recording “serious” flights / tutorials.

4. **Structured troubleshooting beats blindly tweaking**
   - Work systematically through:
     - Hardware  
     - Control bindings  
     - External code  
     - Add-ons that affect physics  
   - Avoid losing time rewriting good code or recalibrating good hardware because of one bad third-party setting.

### 6. Actions Taken

- Disabled / removed the FSRealistic beta flight-dynamics feature used in the 777 profile.  
- Established two conceptual profiles going forward:
  - **“Serious Ops” profile:**  
    - Minimal or no dynamics injection, only subtle enhancements.  
    - Suitable for autoland, training and recording.  
  - **“Cinematic / Chaos” profile:**  
    - Heavier dynamic effects reserved for fun, non-precision flights.
- Personal rule adopted:
  - When an aircraft behaves strangely, **first test with all physics-altering add-ons disabled** before blaming hardware, the aircraft, or custom code.

---

### 7. Final Assessment

The pronounced swerving during autoland was **not** caused by:

- Faulty hardware  
- Bad flight control inputs  
- Node.js / FSUIPC code  
- Or corrupted navdata  

It was driven by **FSRealistic actively modifying the aircraft’s behaviour** via a beta dynamics/landing effect in a community 777 profile, injecting extra yaw/roll disturbances that the autoland system was constantly trying to fight.

Once that effect was removed, autoland performance returned to the expected, stable 777 profile in the same conditions.

## Flight Debrief – Unstable 777 Autoland (S-turns on Short Final)

**Aircraft:** Boeing 777 (MSFS)  
**Add-ons in use:** PMDG 777, FSRealistic (community 777 profile with beta features enabled)  
**Issue:** Pronounced left–right “swerving” during autoland in light crosswind

---

### 1. Summary of the Problem

During several ILS autoland approaches in light crosswind conditions (around 7 kt), the aircraft appeared to:

- Hunt left and right on the localizer  
- Bank noticeably near the ground  
- Give the impression of an unstable or unsafe autoland  

The behaviour was repeatable at multiple airports, which initially suggested:

- Not a single corrupted scenery or localizer  
- Not obviously a hardware calibration problem  
- Not obviously a navdata issue  

The aircraft *looked* like it was “S-turning down the glideslope” instead of tracking a stable path.

---

### 2. Initial Suspects Considered (and Cleared)

The following potential causes were investigated and ruled out:

1. **Throttle hardware / custom motorized throttle**
   - No differential thrust was being commanded.  
   - Both engines were driven symmetrically.  
   - Disconnecting or bypassing the custom throttle did not remove the behaviour.

2. **Primary flight controls (T.16000, etc.)**
   - Control bindings were checked for duplicate aileron/rudder axes.  
   - No stuck or noisy roll/yaw inputs consistently visible on sensitivity graphs.  
   - Issue persisted even when suspicious bindings were removed.

3. **Node.js / FSUIPC / external code**
   - External code was not writing to aileron, rudder or differential throttle offsets.  
   - Autothrottle logic, where active, moved thrust levers together, not asymmetrically.  
   - Disabling external modules did not fully resolve the behaviour.

4. **Airport / navdata issues**
   - The same “swerving” behaviour occurred at multiple, unrelated airports.  
   - This reduced the likelihood of a single bad ILS or misaligned localizer.

At this stage the aircraft, hardware and code were largely exonerated.

### 3. Root Cause: FSRealistic Community Profile (Beta Effect)

The actual culprit was identified as:

> **An FSRealistic profile for the 777 that enabled a beta feature / aggressive landing effects.**

Key points:

- FSRealistic operates primarily on the **camera / head movement**, not the aircraft’s actual flight dynamics.  
- The community profile in use:
  - Was popular and highly rated.  
  - Had one or more **beta / experimental camera effects** enabled.  
  - Applied **strong yaw/roll/sway movement** to the cockpit view, especially:
    - In crosswind landings  
    - At low altitude  
    - Near touchdown  

This meant:

- From the cockpit, the *view* was moving left and right, giving the impression of significant S-turns.  
- In reality, the **autopilot and aircraft were likely tracking the ILS far more smoothly** than the camera suggested.  
- The light 7 kt crosswind + aggressive camera motion made it look like a much more unstable approach than it actually was.

Once the FSRealistic profile was adjusted / the beta feature disabled, the apparent “swerving autoland” disappeared.

### 4. Why It Felt So Real (and Misleading)

Several factors combined to make the illusion convincing:

1. **High visual sensitivity near the ground**
   - Close to the runway, small visual yaw/roll movements translate into dramatic perceived lateral motion.  
   - Even mild camera shake can look like the aircraft is “snaking” down the centerline.

2. **Crosswind context**
   - The presence of a light crosswind primed expectations for some drift and correction.  
   - FSRealistic’s enhanced crosswind / landing effects exaggerated this visually, seemingly confirming “the AP is overcorrecting”.

3. **Workload and attention**
   - The pilot was juggling:
     - Learning the 777’s automation  
     - Managing custom hardware  
     - General flight tasks and distractions  
   - High workload reduces the mental bandwidth to step back and check:
     - External views  
     - Raw localizer deviation  
     - Or to suspect “it’s just the camera”.

4. **Trust in community presets**
   - The profile was “most popular” / highly downloaded, which created an assumption that it was:
     - Tested  
     - Safe  
     - Realistic  
   - In reality, it contained a beta feature that was not suitable for stable autoland evaluation.

### 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Popular ≠ Correct**
   - Community presets and “most downloaded” profiles can introduce extreme or experimental settings.  
   - They should be treated as *starting points*, not reference truth.

2. **Separate camera effects from aircraft behaviour**
   - When something feels wrong in the way the aircraft flies:
     - Cross-check using external views.  
     - Temporarily disable camera-effect add-ons (FSRealistic, etc.) and retest.  
   - If the “problem” disappears with effects off, the issue is perception, not physics or avionics.

3. **Have a “Clean Testing” configuration**
   - Create a profile with:
     - FSRealistic off or heavily toned down  
     - No beta/experimental effects  
     - Minimal addons  
   - Use this state whenever:
     - Testing hardware  
     - Diagnosing odd behaviour  
     - Recording critical flights (e.g. for tutorials/debriefs).

4. **Structured troubleshooting beats guessing**
   - Working systematically through:
     - Hardware  
     - Control bindings  
     - External code  
     - Add-ons  
   - Prevents unnecessary rewiring and code changes chasing the wrong ghost.

### 6. Actions Taken

- Disabled / removed the offending FSRealistic beta feature in the 777 profile.  
- Considered creating two distinct FSRealistic setups:
  - **“Serious Ops” profile:** Mild, non-disruptive effects suitable for autoland, training and recording.  
  - **“Cinematic / Chaos” profile:** More aggressive camera movement reserved for non-critical, just-for-fun flights.  
- Established a personal rule:
  - When something flies strangely, **test first in a clean baseline** (no camera effects, minimal addons) before blaming hardware, aircraft, or code.

### 7. Final Assessment

The apparent swerving during autoland was **not** caused by:

- Faulty hardware  
- Bad flight control inputs  
- Node.js / FSUIPC code  
- Or corrupted navdata  

It was primarily a **visual illusion** created by an overly aggressive FSRealistic profile with a beta landing/crosswind effect enabled, dramatically amplifying cockpit yaw/roll movement near the ground.

After removing that factor, autoland behaviour returned to the expected, stable 777 profile.
